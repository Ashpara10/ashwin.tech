The motivation for pluto came from my past frontend development internship experience at betterstacks
where I was given with a task to implement a WYSIWYG editor using LexicalJS

The task was a bit overwhelming for me at the moment but I got it done anyway, I
was very fascinated by the end product so I decided I will make something similar
too...
