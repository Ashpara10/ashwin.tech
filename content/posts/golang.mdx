This ensures any pages that straight MDX in my /pages directory will also have the code block features.

And finally, I'm generating an RSS feed in my pages/index.jsx file, so I needed to update that method as well, otherwise, I was getting NextJS build errors.

## Understanding channels in golang

- consider a channel to be a tunnel which helps in passing data between processes
- Channels enables us to communicate between goroutnies

## Buffered vs Unbuffered channels

```go:main.go {2,10-11} showLineNumbers

package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main () {
    start:= time.Now()
    resp:= make(chan any,2)

    go fetchPosts(resp chan any)
    go fetchUserLikes(resp chan any)

    for data:=range resp {
       fmt.Println("response:  ",data)
    }
    fmt.Println("took: ",time.Since(start))
}

```

## Why i transitioned to Typescript and why you should too!

- **Typescript** - provides its retrictions and helps to identify bugs during development of your app.
- **Security** -Why you should use TypeScript over [JavaScript](http://vitejs.dev)?
- Image result for why to use typescript
  In contrast to JavaScript, TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to refactor. This enables developers to evade errors and do rewrites much easier.
