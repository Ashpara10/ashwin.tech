Have you ever run into a situation where you end up doing a lot of commits which are similar and could have been put in a single commit?

Well, git has got you covered.

Git provides interactive rebase command which can be used to squash several commits into a single commit.

## Demonstration

- For demonstration, I have already created a git repository with notes.txt.

`Preet Mishra@LegionY520 in squash-demo (master)
$ ls -a
./  ../  .git/  notes.txt`
